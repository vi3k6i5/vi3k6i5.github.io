    <p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Vikash Singh</span>.</p>
    <p>I work as a Senior Software Engineer @ Google.</p>
    <p>I like helping people solve their problems. This has earned me over 14,000 reputation on
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/3027854/vikash-singh">@Stackoverflow</a> and over 1.1 M people reached :)</p>

    <h2>My Open Source Projects:</h2>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/vi3k6i5/flashtext">FlashText</a></h3>
    <p>FlashText can search and replace keywords from text really fast. The algorithm is independent of number of terms. Hence the more number of terms we have in corpus the faster FlashText is in comparison to Regex. The repository has over 5000 Stars :) (Have you stared it yet?)</p>
    <p> I have published a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00046">paper on FlashText</a></p>
    <p> I published a <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/regex-was-taking-5-days-flashtext-does-it-in-15-minutes-55f04411025f">blog post on FlashText</a> which got over 15K claps on Medium :)</p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/vi3k6i5/GuidedLDA">GuidedLDA</a></h3>
    <p>GuidedLDA is a modification over simple LDA model. In this implementation we can seed topics. This is used to create topics as per user understanding. The repository has over 500 Stars :)</p>
    <p> I published a <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-we-changed-unsupervised-lda-to-semi-supervised-guidedlda-e36a95f3a164">blog post on GuidedLDA</a> which got over 700 claps on Medium :)</p>

    <h2>Things I do other than coding:</h2>
    <p>I love <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vi3k6i5/">sketching</a>, listening to music and <a href="https://medium.com/@vi3k6i5">Blogging</a>.</p>
    
    <p>I'm always available to discuss Machine learning, AI, Space, Physics, Animated movies. Let's catch up over <span itemprop="title">Tea</span>, <a href="contact">drop me a line.</a></p>
